            <img src="images/ocean_beach3.jpg" alt="ocean_beach3" style="width:100%;" />
            <p>
                It is easy to find. From Melbourne, take the Monash Freeway, connect onto the Eastlink heading for Portsea, then onto the Peninsula link to Sorrento.
                <br /> Another option is the scenic drive around the beach. Although longer, it allows you to experience the coastline from Port Melbourne to Sorrento.
                <br /> If you choose to come across on the Queenscliff/Sorrento Ferry, it is only a 2 minute drive from the Ferry Depot. <br /> If you are a foot passenger we are happy to meet you at the Sorrento ferry at. Just phone us on 0435 123 456
                as you arrive.
